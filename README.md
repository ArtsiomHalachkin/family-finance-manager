# Finance manager (Python + Flask)
Developed as part of the EBC-VWA - Web Applications Development course.

This web application allows you to manage family members' income and expenses, 
categorized by type. It supports adding users with different roles (e.g., parent, child) and tracking financial activity per person.

## What I Learned

- Designed a relational data model to represent users, roles, and transactions
- Used Jinja2 templating for dynamic HTML rendering
- Handled user input and form validation securely
- Implemented session-based authentication and user role management
- Practiced code modularization and MVC-style architecture
